hello my name is greg this is cool mod i made for minecraft

ok so each team gets a unique trophy and you want to collect the other teams trophy to win (this is multiplayer!!!!!!!!!)

uh so the way you get these trophies is by doing very difficult challenges like getting the dragon egg or making a full beacon and ultimately revealing your base location coordinates to everyone!!!!!!!!!!

after you reveal your coords you have to survive 24 hours defending your base - battles only allowed during the day >:( 

victory is earned through complete victory endurance blah blah blah hold your ground

yay
